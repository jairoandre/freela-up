ZUP Painel
=========

This document describes how to install and build the ZUP Painel project.

# Requirements

 - nvm >= 0.26.0
 - npm >= 2.7.0

# Setup

After cloning the repository:
  
    cd zup-painel
    nvm install
    npm run setup

Create a file name `.env` at the repository's root with the following content:

    API_URL=http://your-api.zupinstance.com
    MAP_LAT=-23.549671
    MAP_LNG=-46.6321713
    MAP_ZOOM=11
    DEFAULT_CITY="SÃ£o Bernado do Campo"
    DEFAULT_STATE=SP
    DEFAULT_COUNTRY=Brasil
  
In order to run tests you also need to set up the following:

    PAINEL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9001
    USER_EMAIL=teste.zup@gmail.com
    USER_PASSWORD=123456

Change the `API_URL` to point to your instance. `MAP`'s `LAT` and `LNG` is used to center the maps starting position. 
`DEFAULT`'s City, State and Country is used an default value for report's addresses fields.
